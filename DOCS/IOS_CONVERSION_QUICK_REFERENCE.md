# iOS Conversion Quick Reference Card

## 🚨 **URGENT: We Built macOS Instead of iOS!**

### **What Went Wrong:**
- ✅ Content pipeline works perfectly (10 prayer guides in Supabase)
- ✅ Supabase integration works
- ❌ **Built macOS Swift Package instead of iOS App**
- ❌ **Uses macOS platform targets and dependencies**

### **Quick Fix Summary:**
**6 Engineers × 2-3 Days = iOS App Ready**

## 👥 **Team Assignments (No Merge Conflicts)**

| Engineer | Focus Area | Files | Duration |
|----------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Engineer 1** | iOS Project Setup | Root directory, Xcode project | 4-6 hours |
| **Engineer 2** | Core Models | `Sources/DeenAssistCore/Models/` | 6-8 hours |
| **Engineer 3** | Supabase Service | `Sources/DeenAssistCore/Services/` | 8-10 hours |
| **Engineer 4** | SwiftUI Views | New `Views/` directory | 10-12 hours |
| **Engineer 5** | Dependencies | `Package.swift`, SPM integration | 4-6 hours |
| **Engineer 6** | iOS Features | Location, notifications, lifecycle | 8-10 hours |

## 🔧 **Critical Changes Required**

### **Remove (macOS-specific):**
```swift
// ❌ REMOVE THESE
import AppKit
import Cocoa
#if os(macOS)
NSView, NSViewController
.macOS(.v10_15)
```

### **Add (iOS-specific):**
```swift
// ✅ ADD THESE
import UIKit
import SwiftUI
import CoreLocation
import UserNotifications
#if os(iOS)
UIView, UIViewController
.iOS(.v16)
```

## ⚡ **Priority Workflow**

### **Day 1:**
1. **Engineer 1**: Create iOS Xcode project (4 hours)
2. **Engineer 5**: Update Package.swift for iOS (2 hours)
3. **Engineers 2,3,4,6**: Start parallel work (6 hours)

### **Day 2:**
1. **All Engineers**: Continue implementation
2. **Integration**: Merge components into iOS project
3. **Testing**: Basic functionality verification

### **Day 3:**
1. **Final Integration**: Combine all work
2. **iOS Testing**: Simulator and device testing
3. **Supabase Verification**: Ensure all 10 guides load
