## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Protocol-First Design
The entire UI is built against service protocols, enabling:
- **Independent Development**: No blocking dependencies on other engineers
- **Easy Testing**: Mock services for comprehensive testing
- **Clean Integration**: Simple protocol replacement during integration
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns

### Key Protocols Implemented
```swift
LocationServiceProtocol     // Location and geocoding
PrayerTimeServiceProtocol   // Prayer calculations
NotificationServiceProtocol // Push notifications
SettingsServiceProtocol     // User preferences
```

### Mock Services Provided
Complete mock implementations for all protocols:
- `MockLocationService`: Simulates location services
- `MockPrayerTimeService`: Provides realistic prayer data
- `MockNotificationService`: Handles permission flows
- `MockSettingsService`: Manages user preferences
