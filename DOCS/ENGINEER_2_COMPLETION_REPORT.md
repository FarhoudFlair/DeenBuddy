## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Protocol-First Design
```swift
// Other engineers can work against these protocols immediately
public protocol LocationServiceProtocol: ObservableObject {
    var currentLocation: LocationInfo? { get }
    func getCurrentLocation() async throws -> LocationInfo
    func requestLocationPermission() async -> LocationPermissionStatus
}
```

### Dependency Injection
```swift
// Clean service registration and resolution
let container = DependencyContainer()
container.register(service: LocationService(), for: LocationServiceProtocol.self)
let locationService = container.resolve(LocationServiceProtocol.self)
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```swift
public enum LocationError: Error, LocalizedError {
    case permissionDenied
    case locationUnavailable
    case accuracyTooLow(Double)
    case timeout
    case networkError
    case geocodingFailed
}
```
