# Repository Guidelines

This guide helps contributors work effectively on the DeenBuddy iOS app. Keep changes focused, tested, and consistent with the existing project layout and tooling.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `DeenBuddy/` — app source: `App/`, `Models/`, `Services/` (e.g., `PrayerTimes`, `Qibla`), `ViewModels/`, `Views/` (feature folders), `Resources/Assets.xcassets`, `Frameworks/DeenAssist*`.
- `Live Activity Widget Extension/` — Widget/Live Activities target (views, models, services).
- `DeenBuddyTests/` — unit/integration tests (XCTest; some files may use Swift Testing).
- `DeenBuddyUITests/` — UI tests (XCUITest).
- `DeenBuddy.xcodeproj/` and `DeenBuddy.xctestplan` — project and shared test plan.
- `fastlane/` — lanes for test, lint, beta, release. `Scripts/` — ad‑hoc test/perf scripts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Build: `xcodebuild build -scheme DeenBuddy -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro'`
- Test (plan): `xcodebuild test -scheme DeenBuddy -testPlan DeenBuddy.xctestplan -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro'`
- Targeted test: `xcodebuild test -scheme DeenBuddy -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' -only-testing:DeenBuddyTests/CacheInvalidationTests`
- Fastlane: `fastlane test` (runs with coverage), `fastlane beta`, `fastlane release`, `fastlane lint` (requires `.swiftlint.yml`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Swift 5+; 4‑space indentation; keep lines under ~120 chars.
- Types/Protocols: UpperCamelCase; functions/vars/enum cases: lowerCamelCase.
- One top‑level type per file; filename matches type (e.g., `PrayerTimeService.swift`).
- Views end with `View`; view models end with `ViewModel`; test files end with `Tests`.
- Use SPM via Xcode for dependencies; avoid new managers without discussion.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: XCTest and XCUITest; project uses `DeenBuddy.xctestplan`.
- Name tests descriptively (e.g., `testCalculationMethodSynchronization`).
- Aim to maintain/raise coverage; add tests for new logic and regressions.
- Run UI tests locally before PRs that change UI flows.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit subject in imperative mood; optional Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`) accepted.
- Keep subjects concise (<72 chars); include a short body with context and a test plan.
- PRs: link issues, describe What/Why, include screenshots for UI changes, list build/test commands used.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets or provisioning profiles. Follow `MANUAL_SIGNING_CONFIGURATION.md` and Fastlane notes.
- Use `fastlane/.env` (see `TESTFLIGHT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`); keep it untracked.
- Coordinate changes that affect bundle IDs, capabilities, or schemes.

## Agent‑Specific Instructions
- Keep patches minimal and focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Follow structure/naming above when adding files or tests.
- If adding a target/scheme, update `DeenBuddy.xcodeproj`, the test plan, and Fastlane lanes as needed.

You are given two tools from Byterover MCP server, including
## 1. `byterover-store-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
+ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
+ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
+ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

## 2. `byterover-retrieve-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
+ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
+ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
+ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase
