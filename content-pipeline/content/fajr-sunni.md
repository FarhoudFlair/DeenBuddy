# Fajr Prayer Guide (Sunni Tradition)

The Fajr prayer is the first of the five daily prayers in Islam, performed before sunrise. This guide will walk you through each step of the Fajr prayer according to Sunni tradition.

## Intention (Niyyah)

Make the intention in your heart to pray the Fajr prayer for the sake of Allah. The intention is made silently in the heart and does not need to be spoken aloud.

نَوَيْتُ أَنْ أُصَلِّيَ فَرْضَ الْفَجْرِ لِلَّهِ تَعَالَى

Transliteration: Nawaitu an usalliya farda al-fajri lillahi ta'ala

## Opening Takbir

Stand facing the Qibla (direction of Kaaba in Mecca). Raise your hands to your ears and say the opening Takbir.

اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ

Transliteration: Allahu Akbar

## Recitation of Al-Fatihah

Place your right hand over your left hand on your chest. Recite Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the Quran).

بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ

Transliteration: Bismillahi ar-rahmani ar-raheem

## Additional Surah

After Al-Fatihah, recite another chapter or verses from the Quran. It is recommended to recite longer chapters during Fajr prayer.

## Ruku (Bowing)

Say "Allahu Akbar" and bow down, placing your hands on your knees. In this position, say:

سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ

Transliteration: Subhana rabbiya al-azeem (Glory be to my Lord, the Great)

## Standing After Ruku

Rise from bowing and say:

سَمِعَ اللَّهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ

Transliteration: Sami'a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him)

Then say:

رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ

Transliteration: Rabbana wa laka al-hamd (Our Lord, and to You is the praise)

## Sujud (Prostration)

Say "Allahu Akbar" and prostrate, placing your forehead, nose, palms, knees, and toes on the ground. Say:

سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى

Transliteration: Subhana rabbiya al-a'la (Glory be to my Lord, the Most High)

## Sitting Between Prostrations

Sit up from prostration and say "Allahu Akbar". In this sitting position, you may make a brief supplication.

## Second Prostration

Prostrate again, saying "Allahu Akbar" and repeat the same glorification as in the first prostration.

## Second Rakah

Stand up for the second rakah, saying "Allahu Akbar". Repeat the same sequence as the first rakah.

## Final Sitting (Tashahhud)

After the second prostration of the second rakah, sit and recite the Tashahhud:

التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلَّهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ

Transliteration: At-tahiyyatu lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat

## Salutations (Tasleem)

Turn your head to the right and say:

السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ

Transliteration: As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah

Then turn your head to the left and repeat the same.
