## 📱 User Interface

### Onboarding Flow
1. **Welcome Screen**: App introduction and value proposition
2. **Location Permission**: Request location access with clear benefits
3. **Calculation Method**: Choose prayer calculation method and madhab
4. **Notification Permission**: Enable prayer reminders

### Main App
1. **Home Screen**: 
   - Next prayer countdown timer
   - Today's prayer times with status indicators
   - Quick access to compass and guides
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **Settings Screen**:
   - Prayer calculation preferences
   - Notification settings
   - Theme selection
   - About information

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI + Combine**: Declarative UI with reactive programming
- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependency management
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Testable, modular architecture
- **CoreLocation**: Location services (Engineer 2)
- **CoreMotion**: Device orientation for compass (Engineer 4)
- **UserNotifications**: Prayer reminders
- **CoreData**: Local data persistence (Engineer 1)

### Service Protocols
- `LocationServiceProtocol`: Location and geocoding services
- `PrayerTimeServiceProtocol`: Prayer time calculations
- `NotificationServiceProtocol`: Push notification management
- `SettingsServiceProtocol`: User preferences and settings

### Mock Services
Complete mock implementations allow UI development without backend dependencies:
- `MockLocationService`: Simulates location services
- `MockPrayerTimeService`: Provides realistic prayer time data
- `MockNotificationService`: Simulates notification permissions
- `MockSettingsService`: Handles user preferences

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
- Component creation and initialization
- Theme manager functionality
- Mock service behavior
- Settings persistence

### UI Tests (Planned)
- Onboarding flow completion
- Prayer time display accuracy
- Settings modification
- Accessibility compliance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Xcode
3. Build and run on simulator or device

### Development
The UI components are fully functional with mock services. To integrate with real services:

1. Replace mock services with concrete implementations
2. Update dependency injection in `AppCoordinator`
3. Test integration between UI and services

## 📋 Next Steps

### Integration Phase
- [ ] Replace mock services with real implementations from other engineers
- [ ] Integrate prayer calculation engine (Engineer 1)
- [ ] Connect location and network services (Engineer 2)
- [ ] Add compass and prayer guides (Engineer 4)

### Testing & Polish
- [ ] Comprehensive UI testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Beta testing with real users

### Release Preparation
- [ ] App Store assets and metadata
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] App Store submission

## 👥 Team Collaboration

This UI implementation follows the parallel development strategy:
- **Independent Development**: Works with mock services
- **Protocol Contracts**: Clear interfaces for service integration
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to integrate with other components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensures reliability during integration
