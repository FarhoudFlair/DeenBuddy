## 🛠️ Content Pipeline

The content management system allows for easy creation and maintenance of prayer guides:

### Content Structure
```markdown
---
contentId: fajr_sunni_guide
title: Fajr Prayer Guide (Sunni)
prayerName: fajr
sect: sunni
rakahCount: 2
---

# Prayer Guide Content
## Step 1: Intention
...
```

### Pipeline Commands
```bash
# Validate all content
npm run validate

# Ingest content (dry run)
npm run ingest -- --dry-run --verbose

# Sync with Supabase
npm run sync

# Check pipeline status
npm start status
```

## 🧭 QiblaKit Usage

The standalone Qibla calculation package can be used independently:

```swift
import QiblaKit
import CoreLocation

let userLocation = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060)
let result = QiblaCalculator.calculateQibla(from: userLocation)

print("Qibla direction: \(result.formattedDirection)")
print("Distance to Kaaba: \(result.formattedDistance)")
print("Compass bearing: \(result.compassBearing)")
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Content Updates
1. Add/edit Markdown files in `content-pipeline/content/`
2. Run validation: `npm run validate`
3. Test ingestion: `npm run ingest -- --dry-run`
4. Deploy: `npm run ingest`

### For iOS Development
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Run tests: `fastlane test`
4. Submit PR (triggers CI)
5. Merge to main (triggers beta build)

### For Releases
1. Update version: `fastlane release`
2. Create GitHub release
3. Submit to App Store

## 📊 Database Schema

### Prayer Guides Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE prayer_guides (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  title VARCHAR(200),
  prayer_name VARCHAR(50),
  sect VARCHAR(20) CHECK (sect IN ('sunni', 'shia')),
  rakah_count INTEGER,
  content_type VARCHAR(20),
  text_content JSONB,
  video_url TEXT,
  is_available_offline BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### QiblaKit Tests
```bash
cd QiblaKit
swift test
```

### Content Pipeline Tests
```bash
cd content-pipeline
npm test
```

### iOS Tests (when project exists)
```bash
fastlane test
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Offline-first**: All core functionality works without internet
- **Efficient Storage**: JSONB for flexible content, binary data for offline assets
- **Lazy Loading**: Content downloaded on-demand with progress tracking
- **Sensor Optimization**: Efficient compass updates with configurable refresh rates

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **No Personal Data**: App doesn't collect or store personal information
- **Local Storage**: All user preferences stored locally in CoreData
- **Secure API**: Supabase with Row Level Security for content management
- **Privacy-First**: Location used only for calculations, never transmitted

]
```

### Xcode Project

1. File → Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter the repository URL
3. Select the version range
4. Add to your target

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup

```swift
import DeenAssistCore

// Create dependency container
let container = DeenAssistCore.createDependencyContainer()

// Setup services
await container.setupServices()

// Access services
let locationService = container.locationService
let apiClient = container.apiClient
let notificationService = container.notificationService
```

### Get Current Location

```swift
// Request permission
let permissionStatus = await locationService.requestLocationPermission()

guard permissionStatus.isAuthorized else {
    print("Location permission denied")
    return
}

// Get current location
do {
    let location = try await locationService.getCurrentLocation()
    print("Current location: \(location.coordinate)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to get location: \(error)")
}
```

### Fetch Prayer Times

```swift
// Get prayer times for today
do {
    let prayerTimes = try await apiClient.getPrayerTimes(
        for: Date(),
        location: location.coordinate,
        calculationMethod: .muslimWorldLeague,
        madhab: .shafi
    )
    
    print("Fajr: \(prayerTimes.fajr)")
    print("Dhuhr: \(prayerTimes.dhuhr)")
    print("Asr: \(prayerTimes.asr)")
    print("Maghrib: \(prayerTimes.maghrib)")
    print("Isha: \(prayerTimes.isha)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to get prayer times: \(error)")
}
```

### Schedule Prayer Notifications

```swift
// Request notification permission
let notificationStatus = await notificationService.requestNotificationPermission()

guard notificationStatus.isAuthorized else {
    print("Notification permission denied")
    return
}

// Schedule notifications for prayer times
do {
    try await notificationService.schedulePrayerNotifications(for: prayerTimes)
    print("Prayer notifications scheduled")
} catch {
    print("Failed to schedule notifications: \(error)")
}
```

### Get Qibla Direction

```swift
do {
    let qiblaDirection = try await apiClient.getQiblaDirection(for: location.coordinate)
    print("Qibla direction: \(qiblaDirection.direction)° (\(qiblaDirection.compassDirection))")
    print("Distance to Kaaba: \(qiblaDirection.formattedDistance)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to get qibla direction: \(error)")
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```swift
// Custom API configuration
let apiConfig = APIConfiguration(
    baseURL: "https://api.aladhan.com/v1",
    timeout: 30,
    maxRetries: 3,
    rateLimitPerMinute: 90
)

// Create container with custom configuration
let container = DependencyContainer(
    apiConfiguration: apiConfig
)
```

### Custom Notification Settings

```swift
// Configure notification preferences
let settings = NotificationSettings(
    isEnabled: true,
    reminderMinutes: 15, // 15 minutes before prayer
    enabledPrayers: [.fajr, .maghrib, .isha], // Only these prayers
    soundEnabled: true,
    badgeEnabled: false,
    customMessage: "Time for prayer! 🕌"
)

notificationService.updateNotificationSettings(settings)
```

### Offline Support

```swift
// Check network status
if apiClient.isNetworkAvailable {
    // Online - fetch fresh data
    let prayerTimes = try await apiClient.getPrayerTimes(...)
} else {
    // Offline - use cached data or local calculations
    let cachedLocation = locationService.getCachedLocation()
    let qiblaDirection = KaabaLocation.calculateDirection(from: cachedLocation.coordinate)
}
```

## Testing

### Using Mock Services

```swift
import DeenAssistCore

// Create test container with mocks
let testContainer = DependencyContainer.createForTesting()

// Configure mock behavior
let mockLocationService = testContainer.locationService as! MockLocationService
mockLocationService.setMockPermissionStatus(.authorizedWhenInUse)
mockLocationService.addMockLocation(LocationInfo(...))

// Test your code
let location = try await mockLocationService.getCurrentLocation()
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suite
swift test --filter LocationServiceTests

# Run with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

## Error Handling

### Location Errors

```swift
do {
    let location = try await locationService.getCurrentLocation()
} catch LocationError.permissionDenied {
    // Handle permission denied
} catch LocationError.locationUnavailable {
    // Handle location unavailable
} catch LocationError.accuracyTooLow(let accuracy) {
    // Handle poor accuracy
} catch {
    // Handle other errors
}
```

### API Errors

```swift
do {
    let prayerTimes = try await apiClient.getPrayerTimes(...)
} catch APIError.networkError(let error) {
    // Handle network issues
} catch APIError.rateLimitExceeded {
    // Handle rate limiting
} catch APIError.serverError(let code, let message) {
    // Handle server errors
} catch {
    // Handle other errors
}
```

### Notification Errors

```swift
do {
    try await notificationService.schedulePrayerNotifications(for: prayerTimes)
} catch NotificationError.permissionDenied {
    // Handle permission denied
} catch NotificationError.schedulingFailed {
    // Handle scheduling failure
} catch {
    // Handle other errors
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- **Location**: 5-minute cache with accuracy validation
- **Prayer Times**: 24-hour cache per location and date
- **Qibla Direction**: 30-day cache per location (rounded to 2 decimal places)

### Rate Limiting

- AlAdhan API: 90 requests per minute
- Automatic throttling with exponential backoff
- Request queuing during rate limit periods

### Memory Management

- Automatic cache cleanup for expired entries
- Maximum cache size: 50MB
- Periodic cleanup every hour
